                                Hi! I'm <span className="font-bold">Andy Álvarez</span>, a <span className="font-bold">front-end developer</span> passionate about technology, 
                                modern web design, and performance optimization. 
                                I specialize in <span className="font-bold">React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS</span>, creating attractive and efficient interfaces.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I'm <span className="font-bold">self-taught</span> and always looking to improve my skills. 
                            I've trained in <span className="font-bold">HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git</span>, constantly exploring new tools and methodologies 
                            to write cleaner and more scalable code.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I'm driven by <span className="font-bold">continuous improvement</span> and <span className="font-bold">lifelong learning</span>. 
                            I enjoy tackling challenges that help me refine my skills and stay up to date with the latest trends in web development.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I'm always open to connecting with other technology enthusiasts. 
                            If you'd like to talk about development, share ideas, or collaborate, I'd love to hear from you!
                            </p>
